# webchat

### Basic Call Flow

In this application, I am targeting a web client which is one of supported clients for this chat service.
In order to make a seamless connection between web client and server, socket.io is a good way to support bidirectional message flow. Also, the application server is based on golang which have a strangth for massice transaction. 

Client <-> Server : Socket.io

Once one of client in a chatroom is not online, PUBSUB is not a good way to commnicate messages. So, the application server saves the message in Queue too using linked list. Then, once a client is back online, the message can be delivered to the client robustly.
